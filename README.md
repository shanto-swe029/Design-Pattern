# Design-Pattern


## What is and why design pattern in software engineering?

A design pattern is a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It provides a structured approach to designing software systems that are flexible, maintainable, and scalable. Design patterns capture best practices and proven solutions developed and refined by experienced software developers over time.

Design patterns are not specific to a particular programming language or technology. They are conceptual templates that can be applied to different situations to solve similar design problems. They promote code reuse, modularity, and maintainability by providing standardized solutions for common design challenges.

Design patterns are categorized into several types, including creational patterns, structural patterns, and behavioral patterns. Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, structural patterns focus on composing objects and classes into larger structures, and behavioral patterns address the interaction and communication between objects.

Some commonly known design patterns include the Singleton pattern, Factory Method pattern, Observer pattern, Decorator pattern, and many more. Each pattern has its specific intent, structure, and implementation details.

By understanding and applying design patterns, software developers can create more robust, flexible, and maintainable software systems. Design patterns are not strict rules or algorithms but rather guidelines that help solve common design problems and promote good software engineering practices.

We can classify the design patterns like the following catalog:

1. Creational Design Patterns
	- Singleton Pattern
	- Factory Method Pattern
	- Abstract Factory Pattern
	- Builder Pattern
	- Prototype Pattern
	- Object Pool Pattern
2. Structural Patterns:
	- Adapter Pattern
	- Bridge Pattern
	- Composite Pattern
	- Decorator Pattern
	- Facade Pattern
	- Flyweight Pattern
	- Proxy Pattern
3. Behavioral Patterns:
	- Observer Pattern
	- Strategy Pattern
	- Template Method Pattern
	- Command Pattern
	- Iterator Pattern
	- Mediator Pattern
	- State Pattern
	- Visitor Pattern
	- Chain of Responsibility Pattern
	- Interpreter Pattern
	- Memento Pattern
4. Architectural Patterns:
	- Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern
	- Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Pattern
	- Layered Architecture Pattern
	- Repository Pattern
	- Dependency Injection Pattern
	- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) Pattern
	- Microservices Pattern
	
It's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and there are many other design patterns beyond those mentioned here. Additionally, some patterns may overlap or have variations depending on different sources and interpretations.

Each pattern in the catalog has its own unique purpose and usage, addressing specific design concerns and promoting good software design principles. It's beneficial to understand the different patterns and their application in order to leverage them effectively when designing and developing software systems.
