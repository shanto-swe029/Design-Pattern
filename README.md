## Prerequisites for Learning Design Patterns

<details> 
	<summary> toggle view/hide </summary>
To effectively learn and understand design patterns, it's helpful to have a solid foundation in programming and software development concepts. Here are some recommended prerequisites for learning design patterns:

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: <br> Design patterns are closely tied to object-oriented principles. Familiarize yourself with concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
2. **Programming Language**: <br> Choose a programming language you're comfortable with, as most design patterns are language-agnostic and can be implemented in various languages. Understanding the syntax and features of your chosen language will facilitate pattern implementation.
3. **Software Design Principles**: <br> Gain knowledge of fundamental software design principles, such as SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion), DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and Separation of Concerns. These principles provide a solid foundation for design patterns.
4. **Experience with Real-World Projects**: <br> Having practical experience in developing software applications will help you appreciate the challenges and scenarios where design patterns can be applied. Working on projects with different requirements and complexities enhances your understanding of design patterns' relevance.
5. **Design and Analysis**: <br> Familiarize yourself with design methodologies like UML (Unified Modeling Language) to express design ideas visually. Understanding class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and other UML artifacts helps in effectively communicating and documenting design patterns.
6. **Basic Data Structures and Algorithms**: <br> Some design patterns work in conjunction with data structures and algorithms. Having a basic understanding of data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.) and algorithms (sorting, searching, graph algorithms, etc.) will be beneficial.
7. **Familiarity with Patterns' Concepts**: <br> Before diving into individual design patterns, grasp the key concepts behind patterns, such as encapsulating variability, separating responsibilities, favoring composition over inheritance, loose coupling, and high cohesion.
8. **Reading and Resources**: <br> Explore books, online tutorials, articles, and resources dedicated to design patterns. Some recommended books include "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Gamma et al. and "Head First Design Patterns" by Freeman et al.


Remember that learning design patterns is an ongoing process that improves with practice and practical application. Start with simpler patterns and gradually progress to more complex ones. Gain hands-on experience by implementing patterns in your projects to reinforce your understanding.

## What is and why design pattern in software engineering?

<details>
	<summary> toggle view/hide </summary>
	
A design pattern is a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It provides a structured approach to designing software systems that are flexible, maintainable, and scalable. Design patterns capture best practices and proven solutions developed and refined by experienced software developers over time.

Design patterns are not specific to a particular programming language or technology. They are conceptual templates that can be applied to different situations to solve similar design problems. They promote code reuse, modularity, and maintainability by providing standardized solutions for common design challenges.

Design patterns are categorized into several types, including creational patterns, structural patterns, and behavioral patterns. Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, structural patterns focus on composing objects and classes into larger structures, and behavioral patterns address the interaction and communication between objects.

Some commonly known design patterns include the Singleton pattern, Factory Method pattern, Observer pattern, Decorator pattern, and many more. Each pattern has its specific intent, structure, and implementation details.

By understanding and applying design patterns, software developers can create more robust, flexible, and maintainable software systems. Design patterns are not strict rules or algorithms but rather guidelines that help solve common design problems and promote good software engineering practices.

## The Catalog of Design Patterns

<details>

We can classify the design patterns like the following catalog:

1. Creational Design Patterns
	- Singleton Pattern
	- Factory Method Pattern
	- Abstract Factory Pattern
	- Builder Pattern
	- Prototype Pattern
	- Object Pool Pattern
2. Structural Patterns:
	- Adapter Pattern
	- Bridge Pattern
	- Composite Pattern
	- Decorator Pattern
	- Facade Pattern
	- Flyweight Pattern
	- Proxy Pattern
3. Behavioral Patterns:
	- Observer Pattern
	- Strategy Pattern
	- Template Method Pattern
	- Command Pattern
	- Iterator Pattern
	- Mediator Pattern
	- State Pattern
	- Visitor Pattern
	- Chain of Responsibility Pattern
	- Interpreter Pattern
	- Memento Pattern
4. Architectural Patterns:
	- Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern
	- Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Pattern
	- Layered Architecture Pattern
	- Repository Pattern
	- Dependency Injection Pattern
	- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) Pattern
	- Microservices Pattern
	
It's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and there are many other design patterns beyond those mentioned here. Additionally, some patterns may overlap or have variations depending on different sources and interpretations.

Each pattern in the catalog has its own unique purpose and usage, addressing specific design concerns and promoting good software design principles. It's beneficial to understand the different patterns and their application in order to leverage them effectively when designing and developing software systems.
